It responds in the register the customer uses — formal Swahili, casual Sheng, or professional English — rather than translating everything to one language.' },
      { q: 'Can ZURI handle order processing, not just enquiries?',           a: 'Yes — for businesses with connected inventory or ordering systems (Shopify, WooCommerce, Quickstore), ZURI can check stock, confirm orders, and trigger fulfilment. For businesses without an integrated system, ZURI handles enquiries and routes orders to your team.' },
      { q: 'What happens when a customer explicitly asks for a human?',       a: 'ZURI immediately acknowledges the request and escalates the conversation to your designated human agent with the full conversation history attached — the customer does not need to repeat themselves.' },

      { q: 'Is the WhatsApp Business API required, or can ZURI work with a regular WhatsApp?', a: 'Meta\'s WhatsApp Business API is required for ZURI to function. NeuroSpark handles the API provisioning as part of onboarding. A regular WhatsApp number can often be migrated to Business API with Meta\'s approval process, which we guide you through.' },
